title: Historical Maps and Geographic Knowledge Graphs
summary: Historical maps contain rich geographic information about the past of a region. This project proposes a general workflow for completing one important step of building a geographic knowledge graph (GKG) from historical maps, namely aligning the same geographic entities from different maps. We experiment with different methods for implementation, and systematically evaluate their performances using two datasets of historical maps..
